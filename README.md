# STM32L433RCT6P – Bare-Metal & HAL Peripheral Examples 🚀

This folder contains a curated collection of **STM32L433RCT6P peripheral examples** written in **bare-metal** (register-level) and **HAL-based** embedded C. The goal is to learn and demonstrate the inner workings of STM32 microcontrollers without relying heavily on abstraction layers.

🧠 **Focus**: Low-level register manipulation, hardware understanding, and peripheral integration using STM32CubeIDE and Nucleo-L433RC-P board.
